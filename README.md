# Movie Application Project

## Real Reviews by Real People

This project is a movie critics application using Restful Api, Angular CLI, & Springboot. This web application creates a user experience to watch and review their films. Each review gives the member a rank/badge, a potential way to earn a directors' seat badge. This encourages the user to access the site frequently to watch more movies and provides validation that they know what films are good or not.
